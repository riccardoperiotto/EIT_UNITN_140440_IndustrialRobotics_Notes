# 140440 Industrial Robotics, notes
Notes about the Industrial Robotic course of the master degree in Autonous System (EIT). 
Course professor: Daniele Bortoluzzi.

The course aim was to study the kinematic, the dynamic and (partially) the control of open chain mechanism. 
This document is a Maple file containing the cases usually studied during the course or requested at the examinations.
The theory behind the code mainly follows the approach of modelling the system using matrices (position, velocity, pseudo inertia tensor..) and the lagrange approach.
Other concepts such as manipulability ellipsoids and control laws are also contained.

The repo contains the Maple file and its export to pdf.
